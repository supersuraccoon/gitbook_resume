This book is, in fact, my online resume.

I happened to have a lot of spare time recently so I updated my resume and made a complete yet detailed summary of all the projects I have done in my career life up till now.

I think it is very important and necessary to record every projects in time no matter big or small it is.

And this time when I was making the work collection list I found that some projects that cost me tons of time to accomplish can never be recovered since I can not find the source codes, a learning note or even a snapshot ...

That's why I decide to use the `GitHub` + `GitBook` to record && update my resume and all the projects I have did and the ones to come in the future.
